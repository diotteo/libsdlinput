Well, this is quite a mess, isn't it?

This is an old project (2008-2009) of mine I've long stopped maintaining. I named it SDL_Input then even though another SDL_Input library exists now and probably existed then. Consequently, this is probably not the SDL_Input you're looking for (unless you are indeed looking for that EditBox widget thing a guy wrote on www.siteduzero.com's forums back in 2008).
