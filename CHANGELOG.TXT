=============
Update log:
=============

(version 1.0.2)
-Added target architecture and target system to packages name
-Moved the update log from README.TXT to CHANGELOG.TXT
-Updated documentation (Added some possible failure reasons and UBs)

(version 1.0.1)
-Changed licence from GNU GPL to GNU LGPL, therefore allowing for more
	users' freedom.
Note: There was a fundamental mistake of mine leading me to think SDL_TTF was
	licenced under GNU GPL while it's not. Therefore, SDL_Input_TTF now can and
	is licenced under GNU LGPL.

(version 1.0.0)
-Split from SDL_Input (see the README.TXT file provided with SDL_Input for
	"previous versions" infos)
